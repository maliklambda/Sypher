# Sypher

A query language for directed property graph databases with a focus on expressiveness.

## Overview

Explain what your project does and why it exists.
The problem Sypher attempts to solve is the bridging of syntactical differences between traditional SQL dialects and modern graph database query languages. 
This is where the project gets its name - "Simpler Cypher" becomes "Sypher". 
With its verbose syntax, Sypher brings the expressiveness and clarity that most SQL dialects have to the realm of graph databases. 

## Key Features

- Declarative syntax — Write queries that describe what to fetch, not how to fetch it.
- Abstraction - Complex low-level operations are described and executed by simple queries.
- Subqueries - Support for recursive subqueries.
